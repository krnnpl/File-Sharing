# File-Sharing-Application

It is file sharing application, built using the MERN stack, combines MongoDB for secure database storage and React for a seamless front-end experience. With two servers running, we ensure optimal performance. This platform simplifies file sharing by providing a robust and intuitive solution. Leveraging MongoDB's document-based structure, we store files securely and access them quickly. React's component-based architecture enables a modern and interactive user interface. 

This file sharing application, leverages various technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. On the frontend, we utilize React's useState hook for managing component-level state, allowing for dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Additionally, we rely on the Axios library for making HTTP requests and fetching data from our backend servers.

Express.js is utilized as the backend framework in our file sharing application. It provides a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js, enabling us to create robust server-side functionality. With Express, we can easily handle routes, middleware, and API endpoints.
